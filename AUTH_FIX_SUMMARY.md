# Authentication Flow Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Auth Callback Handler**: The signup pages were redirecting to `/auth/callback` but this route didn't exist
2. **Database Record Creation**: Space owner signup wasn't creating corresponding database records
3. **Role Detection Mismatch**: Signup stored role in user_metadata, but signin checked database tables
4. **Email Verification Flow**: No proper handling of Supabase email verification callbacks

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Auth Callback Handler (`/src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Handle email verification callbacks from Supabase and create proper database records

**Key Features**:
- Processes Supabase auth tokens from URL
- Creates database records based on user type from signup metadata
- Uses the same role detection logic as signin page
- Sets proper cookies for role persistence
- Redirects to correct dashboard based on detected role

**Logic Flow**:
```
Email Verification Link → /auth/callback → Process Auth → Create DB Record → Detect Role → Redirect
```

### 2. Role Detection Logic

The callback now uses the exact same `checkUserRole` function as the signin page:

1. **Admin Check**: Checks against hardcoded admin emails
2. **Space Owner Check**: Queries `space_owners` table for `auth_id`
3. **Default**: Falls back to 'user' role

### 3. Database Record Creation

**For Space Owners**:
- Creates record in `space_owners` table with `auth_id` pointing to Supabase user
- Sets default commission rate (15.0%) and membership type ('grey')
- Uses user metadata from signup for personal details

**For Individual Users**:
- Creates record in `users` table with `id` matching Supabase user ID
- Sets role as 'user'

### 4. Cookie Management

Sets `stype` cookie with detected role:
- `stype=owner` for space owners → redirects to `/owner`
- `stype=user` for regular users → redirects to `/dashboard`
- `stype=admin` for admins → redirects to `/admin`

## Authentication Flow Now Works As:

### Space Owner Signup:
1. User fills out space owner form on `/signup`
2. `handleSpaceOwnerSignUp` stores `user_type: 'space_owner'` in metadata
3. Supabase sends verification email with link to `/auth/callback`
4. User clicks email link → lands on `/auth/callback`
5. Callback handler:
   - Processes auth tokens
   - Sees `user_type: 'space_owner'` in metadata
   - Creates `space_owners` database record
   - Detects role as 'owner' (via database query)
   - Sets `stype=owner` cookie
   - Redirects to `/owner` dashboard

### Individual User Signup:
1. User fills out individual form on `/signup`
2. `handleIndividualSignUp` stores `user_type: 'individual'` in metadata
3. Email verification → `/auth/callback`
4. Callback handler:
   - Creates `users` database record
   - Detects role as 'user'
   - Sets `stype=user` cookie
   - Redirects to `/dashboard`

### Signin (Both Types):
1. User enters credentials on `/signin`
2. `checkUserRole` queries database to determine role
3. Sets appropriate cookie and redirects

## Key Files Modified

- ✅ `/src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx` - **NEW** - Main callback handler
- ✅ `/src/app/signup/page.tsx` - Already working with proper metadata
- ✅ `/src/app/signin/page.tsx` - Already working with role detection

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test Space Owner Flow**:
   - Go to `/signup`
   - Switch to "Space Owner" tab
   - Fill form and submit
   - Check email for verification link
   - Click link → should redirect to `/owner`
3. **Test Individual Flow**:
   - Go to `/signup`
   - Stay on "Individual" tab
   - Fill form and submit
   - Check email → click link → should redirect to `/dashboard`

## Expected Results

- ✅ Space owners should now properly redirect to `/owner` after email verification
- ✅ Individual users should redirect to `/dashboard`
- ✅ Both should have proper database records created
- ✅ Role detection should be consistent between signup and signin flows

## Technical Notes

- Used TypeScript `as any` casting due to mismatch between schema and generated types
- Callback uses `supabaseAdmin` for database writes to bypass RLS
- Handles URL hash processing for Supabase auth tokens
- Includes error handling and fallback mechanisms
