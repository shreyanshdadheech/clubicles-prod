# Alternative Fix for Permission Issues

## Problem
The error "must be owner of table users" means you don't have the necessary permissions to modify the `public.users` table directly.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Database** → **Tables**
3. Find the `public.users` table
4. Click on the table to view its structure
5. Look for any triggers or constraints that might be causing issues

### Option 2: Check for Existing Triggers
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to see what triggers exist:

```sql
-- Check for triggers on auth.users
SELECT 
    tg.tgname AS trigger_name,
    pg_get_triggerdef(tg.oid) AS definition
FROM pg_trigger tg
JOIN pg_class c ON tg.tgrelid = c.oid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'auth' 
  AND c.relname = 'users' 
  AND NOT tg.tgisinternal;
```

### Option 3: Check for Problematic Functions
Look for functions that might be using `array_agg` incorrectly:

```sql
-- Check for functions using array_agg
SELECT 
    n.nspname AS schema,
    p.proname AS function_name,
    pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) AS definition
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) ILIKE '%array_agg%'
  AND n.nspname IN ('auth', 'public')
ORDER BY p.proname;
```

### Option 4: Check Table Constraints
See what constraints might be causing issues:

```sql
-- Check table structure
SELECT 
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'users'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

### Option 5: Contact Supabase Support
If you can't modify the table directly, you might need to:
1. Contact Supabase support to disable problematic triggers
2. Ask them to fix the permission issues
3. Request help with the `array_agg` error

### Option 6: Create a New Project
As a last resort, you could:
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Import your schema without the problematic triggers
3. Update your environment variables to use the new project

## What to Look For

### Triggers to Disable
Look for triggers that:
- Reference `public.users` in their definition
- Use `array_agg` without proper context
- Don't have proper error handling

### Functions to Fix
Look for functions that:
- Use `array_agg` incorrectly
- Try to insert into `public.users` without error handling
- Have complex logic that might fail

### Constraints to Modify
Look for constraints that:
- Are NOT NULL but auth users don't provide those values
- Are UNIQUE but might conflict with existing data
- Reference columns that don't exist in auth users

## Next Steps

1. **Run the diagnostic queries** to identify the exact issue
2. **Look for triggers** that reference `public.users`
3. **Check for functions** using `array_agg` incorrectly
4. **Identify constraints** that might be causing violations
5. **Contact Supabase support** if you can't fix it yourself

## Expected Results

Once the problematic triggers/functions are identified and fixed:
- ✅ User creation should work
- ✅ Space owner registration should work
- ✅ No more "Database error creating new user" errors
