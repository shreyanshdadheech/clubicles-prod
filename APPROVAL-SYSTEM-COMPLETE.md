# Space Owner Approval System

## 🎯 Overview

The space owner approval system implements a three-tier verification process for new space owner accounts:

- **pending** → Limited access with demo/review message
- **approved** → Full dashboard access with all features
- **rejected** → Account deletion with appeal option

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Added to space_owners table
ALTER TABLE space_owners 
ADD COLUMN approval_status TEXT CHECK (approval_status IN ('approved', 'pending', 'rejected')) 
DEFAULT 'pending';
```

### API Endpoints

1. **Check Approval Status** - `GET /api/owner/approval-status`
   - Returns current user's approval status
   - Used by frontend to determine which view to show

2. **Update Approval Status** - `PUT /api/admin/update-approval-status`
   - Admin endpoint to change approval status
   - Requires: `owner_id`, `approval_status`

3. **Delete Rejected Account** - `DELETE /api/owner/delete-rejected`
   - Removes rejected accounts and all related data
   - Cascading deletion: payment info → business info → spaces → owner → auth user

## 🔄 Approval Workflow

### New Account Creation
```
1. User signs up with business/payment info
2. Account created with approval_status = 'pending'
3. User redirected to /owner (shows pending view)
4. Admin reviews business documents
5. Admin updates status to 'approved' or 'rejected'
```

### Status Transitions
```
pending → approved: Full dashboard access enabled
pending → rejected: Rejection screen with deletion option
rejected → approved: Can be reversed by admin
approved → rejected: Access revoked, shows rejection screen
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Frontend Logic (`/app/owner/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Check approval status on page load
useEffect(() => {
  const checkApprovalStatus = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/owner/approval-status')
    const data = await response.json()
    
    setApprovalStatus(data.approval_status)
    setOwnerInfo(data.owner_info)
    setOwnerId(data.owner_id)
  }
  
  checkApprovalStatus()
}, [user])

// Conditional rendering based on status
{approvalStatus === 'pending' && <PendingApprovalView />}
{approvalStatus === 'rejected' && <RejectedApprovalView />}
{approvalStatus === 'approved' && <FullDashboard />}
```

### Account Deletion Process
```typescript
// Cascading deletion order:
1. space_owner_payment_info (by space_owner_id)
2. space_owner_business_info (by space_owner_id)  
3. spaces (by owner_id)
4. space_owners (by id)
5. auth.users (by auth_id)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Create test account and test all statuses
node test-approval-system.js
```

### Manual Testing Process
1. **Create Account**: Use signup flow
2. **Test Pending**: Should show pending approval screen
3. **Approve Account**: Use admin API to set approved
4. **Test Approved**: Should show full dashboard
5. **Test Rejection**: Set status to rejected, verify deletion works

### Test Commands
```bash
# Create test owner
node create-approved-owner-test.js

# Test complete approval system
node test-approval-system.js

# Update approval status
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/update-approval-status" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner_id":"OWNER_ID", "approval_status":"approved"}'
```
