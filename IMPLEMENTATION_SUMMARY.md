# Clubicles Auth & Routing Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Signup Page (`/signup`)
- **Added Tabs Component**: Implemented shadcn/ui Tabs with two options:
  - **Individual Tab**: For regular users with professional role selection
  - **Space Owner Tab**: For space owners with business information fields

#### Individual Signup Features:
- Personal information (name, email, phone, city, password)
- Professional role selector (with expanded VIBGYOR categories)
- Sets `user_type: 'individual'` in metadata
- Sets cookie `stype: 'user'`

#### Space Owner Signup Features:
- Personal information section
- Business information section (company name, business type, GST, PAN, address)
- Sets `user_type: 'space_owner'` in metadata
- Sets cookie `stype: 'owner'`

### 2. Updated Signin Page (`/signin`)
- **Added Tabs Component**: Two signin options:
  - **User Login Tab**: For individual users with professional role selection
  - **Space Owner Tab**: For space owners (with informational message)

#### Smart Role Detection:
```typescript
const checkUserRole = async (userId: string) => {
  // 1. Check if admin (via hardcoded admin emails list)
  // 2. Check if space owner (via space_owners table query)
  // 3. Default to regular user
}
```

#### Automatic Routing Based on Role:
- **Admin users** → `/admin`
- **Space owners** → `/owner`
- **Regular users** → `/dashboard`

### 3. Created Tabs UI Component
- Added `@/components/ui/tabs.tsx` using Radix UI primitives
- Styled to match the existing design system
- Fixed TypeScript issues with optional className props

### 4. Enhanced Admin Signin
- Updated admin signin to set `localStorage.setItem('adminAuth', 'true')`
- Added role checking for admin emails before setting auth flag

## Database Schema Integration

The implementation is designed to work with the provided database schema:

### Tables Expected:
- `public.users` - Standard user table
- `public.space_owners` - Space owner records with `auth_id` linking to users
- `public.space_members` - Space membership management
- `public.resources` - Space resources with proper RLS policies

### Role Detection Logic:
1. **Admin**: Checked via hardcoded email list (can be changed to JWT claims)
2. **Space Owner**: Database query to `space_owners` table with `auth_id = user.id`
3. **User**: Default role for authenticated users

## Authentication Flow

### Signup Flow:
1. User selects Individual or Space Owner tab
2. Fills required information
3. Supabase auth signup with metadata
4. Sets appropriate `stype` cookie
5. Redirects to email verification

### Signin Flow:
1. User selects User or Space Owner tab  
2. For users: Must select professional role
3. Authentication via Supabase
4. Role detection via database/admin list
5. Cookie setting based on detected role
6. Automatic routing:
   - Admin → `/admin`
   - Owner → `/owner` 
   - User → `/dashboard`

## Key Features

### Security:
- Role-based access control
- JWT token validation
- RLS policies enforced
- Admin access restricted to specific emails

### User Experience:
- Clear tabbed interface
- Professional role selection for users
- Business information collection for owners
- Automatic routing based on user type
- Consistent design language

### Technical:
- TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Radix UI components
- Supabase integration
- Server-side cookie management

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Signup Flow:
- Visit `/signup`
- Try both Individual and Space Owner tabs
- Verify form validation
- Check email verification flow

### 2. Test Signin Flow:
- Visit `/signin`
- Try both User and Space Owner tabs
- Test with different account types
- Verify automatic routing

### 3. Test Role-based Routing:
- Sign in as regular user → should go to `/dashboard`
- Sign in as space owner → should go to `/owner`
- Sign in as admin email → should go to `/admin`

### 4. Test Admin Access:
- Use admin emails: `shreyanshdadheech@gmail.com`, `admin@clubicles.com`, `yogesh.dubey.0804@gmail.com`
- Should automatically route to admin panel
- Or use `/admin/signin` for dedicated admin login

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Ensure the space_owners table exists with proper structure
2. **JWT Claims**: Consider moving admin detection to JWT claims instead of hardcoded emails
3. **Owner Dashboard**: Verify owner dashboard has proper functionality
4. **Professional Roles**: Ensure professional categories are properly stored and used
5. **Email Verification**: Test complete signup flow including email verification

The implementation is now complete and ready for testing! The signup and signin pages both have proper tabbed interfaces, role detection works automatically, and users are routed to the appropriate dashboards based on their roles.
